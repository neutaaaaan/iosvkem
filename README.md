**Iosvkem** is a colourscheme based on the default dark theme for [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets).  
It got its name from the [Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/) 
typeface, as its website is where I first noticed the colourscheme.

It supports both true colours and 256 colours terminal emulators. There is 
some limited support for monochrome terminals, which I can only hope will be 
useful to our children as they hide from the radioactive fallout in underground
bunkers.

I have no interest in supporting 3rd party plugins, or alternative syntax files
unless the default files that ship with vim are broken or inferior to the point
of being useless.

I have had to rewire a few things for markdown, rst and diffs to work properly,
but the rest of the theme respects the conventions built-in within vim. 
Switching from Iosvkem to another theme shouldn't break anything else.


Iosvkem was made using [colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).
It's good. Try it.
