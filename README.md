**Iosvkem** is a colourscheme based on the default dark theme for [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets).  
It got its name from the [Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/) 
typeface, as its website is where I first noticed the colourscheme, and, Google
having become impossibly hard to wrangle valid results out of, especially with
specific queries, assumed it was original.

It supports both true colours and 256 colours terminal emulators. There is 
some limited support for monochrome terminals, which I can only hope will be 
useful to our children as they hide from the radioactive fallout in underground
bunkers.

I have no interest in supporting 3rd party plugins, or alternative syntax files
unless the default files that ship with vim are broken or inferior to the point
of being useless.

I have had to rewire a few things for markdown, rst and diffs to work properly,
but the rest of the theme respects the conventions built-in within vim. 
Switching from Iosvkem to another theme shouldn't break anything else.


Iosvkem was made using [colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate).
It's good. Try it.

#### Installation instructions

**1998**: `Iosvkem.vim` goes in `~/.vim/colors/`.
